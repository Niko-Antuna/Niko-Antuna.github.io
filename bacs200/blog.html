            Social implications as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic have shown to have major effects having anything to do with social interaction. As a result, there has been disruptions of the normal everyday life for everyone in the world such as work, school, social/family relationships, etc. This is due to the fact mandated social distancing is required in most places to help contain the spread of Covid-19 from one person to another.

            A result of this is Congress has had to send out stimulus checks to families being affected by the implications of the pandemic. Despite these checks many families have struggled to make ends meet especially ones without health insurance and access to sick leave if they or someone in their family were to get the Corona Virus. The biggest problem were seeing is with lower wage workers in service industries where they are at risk of losing there job or being called back to go work more slowly due to limited pay.

            Political implications as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic have required the government to act and respond to the people of America that need help/guidance during this period. Depending on how local, state, and federal governments respond as a result of the pandemic with influence elections. This may cause voters to shift their perspectives of the governments effectiveness in responding during the pandemic. This is going to cause politicians and government officials to step up and show they are truly capable of leading this country in a time when the people of America most need guidance to get us safely past this pandemic.

                In conclusion we have seen that the Covid-19 pandemic has had effects throughout our entire country whether this is socially, economically, or politically. The cons have continued to alter our lives making things much harder for the American family than they used to be. While it seems the cons of this pandemic out way the pros there is still some. The result of a pandemic like this is it will better our government officials for the future. It will cause government officials to be better equipped to handle situations like this one if something were to arise like this again. This will allow us to take what we didnâ€™t do well during this pandemic and improve our approach for future problems like this.
